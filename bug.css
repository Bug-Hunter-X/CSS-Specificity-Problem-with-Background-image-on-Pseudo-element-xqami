The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of a background-image on a pseudo-element does not occur because of an unexpected interaction with specificity and inheritance:

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightgray;
}

.container::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-image: url('https://via.placeholder.com/150');
}
```

The expected outcome is that a placeholder image will be displayed on top of the light gray background. However, because of specificity rules, and the element being a pseudo-element, the background-image may not appear as expected. This is particularly true if there are other styles applied to the `.container` element or its parent elements which conflict with the pseudo-element's styles.
